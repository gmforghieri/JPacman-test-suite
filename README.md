# Jpacman-test-suite
 ## About the Project
 This project was part of the Software Quality and Testing course I have taken.
 The codebase of a Pacman game implemented in Java was supplied to the students,
 for which they had to write extensive testing with an array of testing techniques.
 Furthermore, static analysis tools such as SpotBugs, PMD and Checkstyle have also been introduced and used.
 
 Testing techniques utilized in the project: smoke testing, unit testing, boundary testing,
 regression testing, integration and system testing, model and state-based testing,
 structural testing and mocking, fuzzing, security testing.
 
 The tests implemented by me can be found under src/test.
 
 ## Technologies utilized
 Mockito, JUnit, Gradle
